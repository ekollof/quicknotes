# Quick notes

The Quick notes application, is an application to take quick notes -Forgive the
redundancy :sweat_smile:- on small cards, organizedby colors and tags. It allows
a basic rich text as **Bold**, *italic*, and numbered or bullet list to improve
the notes. Also it allows attaching files, and the notes can be shared as
read-only to other users.
